FAU math thesis
================
# Description
A LaTex template for math students of FAU.
# Authors
* Tim Roith
# What does it do?
The provided class and style files set up a convinient environment that 
allows students to create a good looking thesis. The class is designed 
for this specific purpose and follows the doctrine simplicity over 
flexibility.
# What does it not do?
Some of the design decisions greatly decrease the overall flexibility 
of the class. But in the end doesn't every line of code written do so?
As mentioned above, the goal of this project is to provide a easy to use 
template for writing a math thesis that produces solid results. 
Thus we only provide flexibility within the boundary of this task. 
The most important point to note in this context is that we use a
KOMA script as the base class. This is a fundamentally different approach 
than most of the comparable packages took, it is motivated by above mentioned 
doctrine.

# How to use
Theres currently a short documentation in the making. This whole poject 
actually started as a LaTeX tutorial and we will try to provide a similiar 
one in the example file of this repo. Here we use a rather unconventional 
format, which will be a didactic introduction to the class.
# Git Workflow
Mess around with forks, this helps!
# License
License is MIT. We are aware of more specific solutions for LaTeX documents, 
but it is not clear yet, which license will enable students to use this 
template freely without losing the connection to its origin. If you have 
experience with this topic, feel free to suggest a bettersolutions.
